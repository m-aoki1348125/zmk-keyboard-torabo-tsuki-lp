## Core Architecture

### 1. Keymap System
The Keymap System is the central component managing keyboard layers, processing input events, and routing them to appropriate behaviors.

**Key Components**:
- **Layers**: Organized functionality where each layer contains bindings (behaviors assigned to key positions)
- **Layer States**: Layers can be activated, deactivated, or toggled
- **Event Processing**: Iterates through active layers from highest to lowest priority
- **Binding Resolution**: Retrieves behavior bindings for key positions and invokes behaviors via `zmk_behavior_invoke_binding`

### 2. Behavior System
Acts as an intermediary between the keymap system and HID system, processing key events and determining actions.

**Core Architecture**:
- Uses `zmk_behavior_binding` structures to associate keys with behaviors and parameters
- All behaviors implement standard driver API with `binding_pressed` and `binding_released` methods
- Returns `ZMK_BEHAVIOR_OPAQUE` (fully handled) or `ZMK_BEHAVIOR_TRANSPARENT` (pass to next layer)
- Uses behavior queue (`zmk_behavior_queue`) for timing-sensitive sequences like macros

**Behavior Localities**:
- `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_CENTRAL`: Processed on central device
- `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_EVENT_SOURCE`: Processed on triggering device
- `BEHAVIOR_LOCALITY_GLOBAL`: Affects all connected devices

### 3. HID Implementation
Generates HID reports for host communication, handling keyboard, mouse, and consumer control reports.

## Behavior Types

### Key Press Behaviors
- **`&kp` (Key Press)**: Sends keycodes to host
- **`&mt` (Mod-Tap)**: Different actions for tap vs hold (configurable flavors: `hold-preferred`, `balanced`)
- **`&kt` (Key Toggle)**: Toggles key states (e.g., Caps Lock)
- **`&sk` (Sticky Key)**: Keeps modifier active until another key is pressed
- **`&caps_word`**: Capitalizes alphabetic keys until non-alpha key pressed
- **`&key_repeat`**: Repeats last sent keycode

### Layer Navigation Behaviors
- **`&mo` (Momentary Layer)**: Enables layer while key is pressed
- **`&lt` (Layer-Tap)**: Layer when held, keycode when tapped
- **`&to` (To Layer)**: Enables specific layer, disables all others
- **`&tog` (Toggle Layer)**: Toggles layer active/inactive state
- **`&sl` (Sticky Layer)**: Activates layer until another key is pressed

### Miscellaneous Behaviors
- **`&trans` (Transparent)**: Passes key press to next active layer
- **`&none`**: Swallows key press, prevents any action

### Advanced Behaviors
- **Macros**: Sequences of behaviors with configurable timing
- **Tap Dance**: Different behaviors based on tap count
- **Mod-Morph**: Conditional behaviors based on modifier states
- **Combos**: Multiple key combinations triggering behaviors

        default_layer {
            bindings = <
                &kp Q    &kp W    &kp E    &kp R    &kp T
                &kp A    &kp S    &kp D    &kp F    &kp G
                &mo 1    &kp X    &kp C    &kp V    &kp B
            >;
        };
        
        function_layer {
            bindings = <
                &kp F1   &kp F2   &kp F3   &kp F4   &kp F5
                &trans   &trans   &trans   &trans   &trans
                &trans   &trans   &trans   &trans   &trans
            >;
        };
    };
};
```

### Build Process

    combo_esc {
        bindings = <&kp ESC>;
        key-positions = <0 1>;
        layers = <0>;
    };
};
```

### Macros
